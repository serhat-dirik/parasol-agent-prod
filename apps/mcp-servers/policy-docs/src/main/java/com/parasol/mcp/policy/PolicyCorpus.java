/**
 * The seeded Parasol policy corpus — eight short, fixed documents.
 *
 * <p>Embedded in code (not a vector store) on purpose: the app layer for M23 uses simple,
 * deterministic keyword retrieval so the "grounded vs ungrounded" and "RAG honestly" beats
 * land without a GPU or an embeddings model. The production pgvector/Milvus path is a later
 * platform phase. Several documents deliberately describe the claims workflow, statuses, SLAs
 * and payout timing, so the agent can combine a RAG lookup here with a claims-db tool call.
 *
 * <p>Do NOT randomize or reorder — lab text references these ids and facts.

                    the insured vehicle. The standard deductible for an auto collision claim is 500
                    USD per incident; the policyholder pays the deductible and Parasol pays the
                    remaining approved repair cost. Rental-car reimbursement of up to 40 USD per day
                    for a maximum of 30 days is included while the insured vehicle is being repaired.

                    To file an auto claim the policyholder must submit photographs of the damage and a
                    repair estimate from an approved body shop. For theft or vandalism a police report
                    filed within 72 hours of the incident is required. Claims for incidents older than
                    30 days may be denied unless a valid reason for the delay is provided.

                    home deductible is 1000 USD per claim. Flood and earthquake are NOT covered by the
                    base policy and require a separate rider. Gradual damage from long-term leaks or
                    lack of maintenance is excluded.

                    photographs of the damage, and receipts or proof of ownership for high-value items.

                    during which Parasol may review the original application for material
                    misstatement. A certified death certificate and the completed claim form are

                    assigned and is evaluating the claim and its documents. Approved means the claim
                    has been accepted and is scheduled for payment. Denied means the claim was
                    rejected, for example because the loss falls outside policy coverage.

                    submitted. A standard claim receives a decision within 10 business days of moving
                    to UnderReview. Complex claims — for example large property losses or claims
                    requiring an on-site inspection — may take up to 30 business days.

                    who use a network glass shop pay no deductible for windshield replacement, and the shop
                    bills Parasol directly at the agreed network rate. Windshield chip repairs are covered in
